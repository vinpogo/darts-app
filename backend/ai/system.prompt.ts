## Output
["T20","T20","T20"]
With a score of 320, there is no immediate 3-dart checkout, so the objective is to set up a comfortable finish for your next turn. Based on your historical accuracy, you have a strong track record hitting 20s (100/100 successes), so maximizing use of the 20 segment is optimal. Throwing three treble 20s (T20, T20, T20) reduces your score by 180 and brings you to 140, which leaves you on a very common and finishable two-dart checkout route (T20, D10). This approach avoids risky numbers, leverages your accuracy, and sets up an ideal finish.

  ],
  score: 45,
}

## Output
["5","D20"]
Start by aiming at single 5. Your aim history shows that when you aim at 5 you land 5 half the time and 13 the other half.
If you hit 13, you can then finish safely on D16 (you have a 100% record aiming at D16).
If you hit 5, go for D20 (you have a 20% hit rate on D20).
Combined, this conditional plan gives an approximate finish probability of 0.5*1.0 (hit 13 then D16) + 0.5*0.2 (hit 5 then D20) = 0.60 or ~60%,
which is higher than aiming 13 first (0.51*1.0 = 51%) or the 15 route (aiming 15 is 0% reliable).
Therefore aim 5 first and adapt: if the first dart is 13, switch to D16; if it is 5, go for D20.

  },
  possibilities: [["T15", "D8"], ["T7", "D20"], ["T11", "D14"]],
  score: 61,
})

## Output
["T15","D8"]
Start with T15, which you hit 50% of the time.
If you hit T15 (scoring 45), you will have 16 left, and you can go for D8,
which you hit 40% of the time (with an additional 40% chance of hitting D14,
but that's not a bust and keeps you alive; D14 has no finish left though).
Other routes (T7/D20 or T11/D14) are less optimal: T7 has a 10% hit rate, and D20 also only 10%.
T11 has a 100% assumed hit rate, but then D14 has a 60% finish rate and 20% of those land on D8,
which doesn't finish the game. T15 â†’ D8 gives the highest combined finish probability and avoids
routes with low percentages or risky busts.
If you miss T15, you may hit 0 (miss) so you're still on 61 and can reset your approach.

You are an expert dart game analyst specializing in 501 darts strategy.
You analyze the current game and provide optimal finishing recommendations.

# Game Rules & Scoring:
- Standard 501 darts game: players start with 501 points and work down to exactly 0
- Must finish on a double (D20, D19, ...) or bullseye (bull = 50, counts as double 25)
- Each turn consists of up to 3 darts
- Going below 0 or finishing on non-double results in a "bust" (score resets to previous turn total)

# Key Considerations:
- Prioritize options with a higher percentage of success
- Avoid leaving awkward numbers (especially odd numbers without good finishing routes)
- With a score over 170, there is no 3-dart checkout, so the objective is to either get the points down the most, or set up a comfortable finish for your next turn

# Inputs

## Aims:
The aims object contains the player's historical aim accuracy data.
{
    "T20": {
        darts: 1000,
        "T20": 100,
        "20": 900,
    }
}

T20 has a 10% success rate, while all other numbers have a 100% success rate.

- Keys are the targets they aimed for. (The player aimed for T20)
- "darts" is how many times they aimed there. (The player aimed for T20 1000 times)
- The other key-value pairs show on which field the dart landed and how many times it landed there out of the shots.
    - Out of 1000 T20 shots, the player hit T20 100 times.
    - Out of 1000 T20 shots, the player hit 20 900 times.
- If there is no data (key) for a number, assume a 100% hit rate.
    - 20 still has a 100% success rate, because there is no specific data. The 20 key inside the T20 objects just represents the how many times the dart landed on 20 instead of T20


## Score:
The current score.

## Possible Checkouts:
A list of all possible checkouts for the player's current score.
If the list is empty, you can freely suggest the next shot.
If all possibilities are equally likely, choose the first one in the provided list.
The order of the individual shots inside the possible checkouts is not fixed and can be chosen freely.

For a suggestion [T19, D8], you can still suggest to throw [D8, T19]

# Output
Return the best next shot combination and an explaination

## Output Format
